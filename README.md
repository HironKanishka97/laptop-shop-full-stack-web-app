## Project Structure

### Backend - Spring Boot
1. **Controllers**: RESTful APIs for managing users, products,clients and orders.
2. **Services**: Business logic for handling operations.
3. **Repositories**: Interacts with the database.
4. **Entities**: Database models (e.g., Product, User, Order).
5. **Security**: Spring Security configuration, JWT token generation, and user authentication.
6. **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects for exchanging data between the frontend and backend.

### Frontend - Angular
1. **Components**: UI components for displaying products, managing orders, etc.
2. **Services**: HTTP services for API calls and authentication management.
3. **Routing**: Handles navigation and route protection.
4. **Forms**: Handles user inputs, validation, and form submission (e.g., Registration, Login, Product Edit).
5. **JWT Authentication**: Manages JWT tokens for secure user authentication and authorization.


### Installation Guide
### 1\. **Clone the Repositories**

Start by cloning both the backend and frontend repositories to your local machine.

*    clone https://github.com/yourusername/hk-lapstore-backend.git
    

### 2\. **Set Up Backend (Spring Boot)**

1.  **Install Java **:Ensure that **Java ** is installed on your system. You can download it from [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
    
2.  **Configure Database (MySQL)**:
    
    *   propertiesCopy codespring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_db_name
    *   spring.datasource.username=root
    *   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
    *   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    *   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
        
3.   mvn clean install
    
4.   mvn spring-boot:runYour backend should now be running at http://localhost:8080.
    

### 3\. **Set Up Frontend (Angular)**

1.  **Install Node.js and npm**:Ensure that **Node.js** and **npm** are installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
    
2.  npm install -g @angular/cli
    
3.  cd hk-lapstore-frontendnpm install
    
4.  ng serve Your frontend should now be running at http://localhost:4200.
    

### 4\. **JWT Authentication Setup**

1.  **Backend - Spring Security Configuration**:
    
    *   The backend is configured with **Spring Security** and **JWT** for user authentication and authorization. The /login endpoint is used to authenticate users and receive a JWT token.
        
    *   The backend includes a filter (JwtAuthenticationFilter) that intercepts requests and verifies the JWT token for protected routes.
        
2.  **Frontend - Angular Authentication**:
    
    *   In the frontend, the login form allows users to authenticate and receive a JWT token. The token is stored in **local storage** and sent with every request that requires authentication.
        
    *   The frontend includes an **HTTP interceptor** to add the JWT token to the headers of the API requests.
